# Pokemon Gold Generation 1
This is an ASM hack of Pokemon Gold that reintroduces all the Generation 1 music, plus a whole slew of new songs specifically for this hack.

# Features/Changes
While this hack has relatively few changes outside of music, it does have a few noticeable/inevitable changes.


-The Bug Catching contest has a boosted encounter rate due to the map music's inclusion with encounter rate multipliers.

-Kanto's map music is closer to what it was in RBY.

-You can talk to Jigglypuff at the Radio Tower or the Pewter City Pokemon Center and hear the Jigglypuff jingle from RBY.

-The Magnet Train now plays the new Pokemon Channel music. (Though this started as a mistake, I kept it in because it fit.)

-The cry distortion bug has been entirely fixed.  Each cry that was possibly susceptable to this bug had "pitch_sweep 0, 8" amended at the beginning.

-The NPC-trades boast better nicknames for Pokemon, such as Brent, Capper and Sandy.

-Brent's Bitter Berry was replaced by a Metal Coat, but he doesn't evolve when you get him.
